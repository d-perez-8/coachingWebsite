    dt.mb-2 Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
    dd.mb-4 Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Sass gives you the power of variables, mixins, functions, etc.
    dt.mb-2 Pug (former Jade)
    dd.mb-4 Pug is a high performance Node.js Templating Engine. Just like SASS, Pug is a prepocessor and, as such it helps you accomplishing tasks like wrapping away repetitive work by providing features not available in plain HTML like variables, includes, mixins, functions, etc.
    
  h2.h3.pt-3 Compiling Sass (Scss) and Pug
  p.mb-4 The fastet way is up and going with Sass (Scss) and Pug is to use Gulp setup that comes with Around. Check <a href='dev-setup' class='fw-semibold'>Dev environment setup</a> article for the instructions.
  p If you are not using Node.js and Gulp setup, don't like command line interface there are another ways to work with preprocessors. But if you decide to go with any option described below you have to <span class='fw-semibold text-dark'>update the paths</span> to <span class='fw-semibold text-dark'>Bootstrap files</span>. By default they are imported from <code>node_modules</code> folder. But if you don't use Npm / Gulp setup and don't run <code>npm install</code> you will not have the <code>node_modules</code> folder. In that case you can find Bootstrap files inside <code>assets/vendor</code> folder. So you have to update all <code>@import</code>(s) inside your <code>sass</code> files to poit to the right directory <code>assets/vendor</code>.
